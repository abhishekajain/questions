All the nodes in a cluster play the same role. Each node is independent and at the same time interconnected to other nodes.

Each node in a cluster can accept read and write requests, regardless of where the data is actually located in the cluster.

When a node goes down, read/write requests can be served from other nodes in the network.
 Cassandra uses the Gossip Protocol in the background to allow the nodes to communicate with each other and detect any faulty nodes in the cluster.
 
 Components of Cassandra
The key components of Cassandra are as follows -

Node - It is the place where data is stored.

Data center - It is a collection of related nodes.

Cluster - A cluster is a component that contains one or more data centers.

Commit log - The commit log is a crash-recovery mechanism in Cassandra. Every write operation is written to the commit log.

Mem-table - A mem-table is a memory-resident data structure. After commit log, the data will be written to the mem-table. Sometimes, for a single-column family, there will be multiple mem-tables.

SSTable - It is a disk file to which the data is flushed from the mem-table when its contents reach a threshold value.

Bloom filter - These are nothing but quick, nondeterministic, algorithms for testing whether an element is a member of a set. It is a special kind of cache. Bloom filters are accessed after every query.
